## dialogue between two characters

"It's a good thing you've lost your sense of humor, son. Humor and 
entertainment cannot grant you any dignity."

"I don't understand. The nonsensical things in life, when talked about and
trivialized, bond people together towards a unified sense of truth."

"But you are not in the position. Look at you, you barely have enough 
food to eat and no one wants you. There is no point in expressing these
nonsensical things because of two reasons. The first reason is that those
things are most likely taken for granted. The second reason is that if
those things are not taken for granted, then they should not be expressed
in a trivial and mocking manner because that would greatly upset present
truths."

"If I am not in the position now, then when will I ever be in the position?
If I am to assume a role that requires nothing but serious words and 
responsible actions, then I cannot say or do anything out of sorts. At least
for now, I do not have to be so serious and pass such harsh judgments onto
others."

"Don't be foolish. Your judgment does not matter because of your position.
Are you to continue playing a fool? No one wants to be your wife, you can't
even get a job to save your life. The only friends you have cannot even help
themselves. Maybe that is why they've stayed friends with you. But you're still
not any better than anyone."

"Well, look at you. What heights have you reached? You are just older than me
but you seem to think you are incapable of also being a fool because you've
lived longer. You believe that because you act serious and steer away from
making or taking jokes, that everyone sees you in a serious way. You think
no one can look at you and critique you except for personally insulting you."

"Firstly, I achieved way more than you when I was your age. I did not spend
my time entertaining lofty notions about paradise. There is already a book,
the only book you should have read, called Paradise Lost by John Milton.
Maybe you can understand if you are so smart. " 
 
"When did I ever mention paradise? You were chastising me for my mocking tone
on things I find nonsensical. You said --" 

"This is exactly what I have been talking about! Maybe you never mentioned
paradise but the way you say things, you clearly have a low opinion of what
is possible and already here. And you think paradise can be achieved if the
nonsense you are always joking about goes away. Case in point, you are a fool
in it all."  

"Then we will sit here and continue arguing. I surely can't achieve all the
things you think I should. All else being equal, perhaps it is me that has
fallen below the mark."

"Then you clearly admit that you are beneath what people expect. You are a
disappointment so why would you want to continue arguing? I will just sit
here and continue to think that you are a fool. Now, tomorrow, I want you 
to get up early to look for something that will make you better. I wish you
the best of luck, genuinely, son. But you are so weak. You must grow stronger
or any wife or work you get solely because of the good luck I give you, 
I can dive in and take for myself. Or worse, some other person will. And they
surely think of you lower than just a fool."

## a conversation about ridiculousness

"Do you see now, son? Your mockery has caused much commotion out on the
streets because those that don't work for money spend their time on themselves
first and others later. And the others that are served later are served with
crumbs and mockery!"

"What have you heard now? What could I possibly done wrong now?"

"It is not what you have done that many people have not seen but what people
say. There are people that have been saying all kinds of things about you...
how you are a crazed maniac and you want things in your head but cannot want
them through your actions. They say that you live in your own world and think
you're on top and that you think you are better than everyone, always keeping
your own thoughts to yourself. But when you see people, you know that you are
nobody and that they don't need to pay you jack. They are mocking you so 
hard, son!"

"I don't understand, even less so now that you've explained. Maybe it is because
you've explained to me these things in so many words about strangers with 
their dark talk in their cozy sunshine that you've ended up confusing me about
what I specifically did and how I should feel about it."

"I don't know what else to say but --"

"Then why say it? What are you continuing to say?"

"Don't ever cut me off, idiotovyo. What people say matters, and the things they
say about you are not cherry dairy. You should understand that a person's words
about another matter so much in their own status and role in relation to the 
other. So you should tread very carefully because these speakers come in many
shades and heights. And they are not like in the movies with their dramatic 
expression. Their words might impact you in ways that matter but are 
indescribable on the television screen. Besides, you're not television 
material."

"You know that words cannot be taken seriously, I'm sure? There are such things
as jokes, sarcasm, and cliches that make for small talk. That is the only 
matter, small and almost nothing, that comes out of socializing that does 
not involve a big bag of money in some form at some place. And you continue 
speaking with the confidence of the best teacher to me, you are starting 
to make me laugh."

"Did you know that not too long ago, most people were illiterate? Imagine the
vocabulary that the illiterate use to talk to each other. But I'm sure those
people back then used other forms of communication to send the same messages
across. But those people had rougher lives, believe me. They might as well
have grunted and hee-hawed to each other to express their commitment and
affection for each other. But if you want to end up with a life as rough as
theirs, then you should know that it is because of the degradation of 
communication."

"For a layman, you are using an awful lot of big words. You think with those
big words, you can inject reason into me and make me smarter and more perfect
in your imagined form. Then tell me why we are still talking and arguing,
basically grunting and hee-hawing to each other." 

"Fine, then I will go ahead with the finishing point of my talk. People say
that you did embarassing things, intentionally, and that you must be very
dull and ignorant underneath to take away delusions instead of lessons from
those embarassing things. People say that what you did would make for good
television stories and that you are the bad egg sitting underneath all the
prime ones that are eaten first. Then they say this is proof of how unfair 
life is."

"You have been saying a lot of things to me in this conversation, and I can
remember less than a third of it. I don't understand what your aim is, but
you are not entertaining or educating me in this sitting."

"I will not be more specific because I do not want to upset you and make
you feel violated by my revealing what I know."

"Then how would I know that you know? Maybe you are simply pretending to know.
That is what I assume, the simpleton that you are." 

"The evidence is there for why people assume they know your embarassing deeds.
Maybe 'embarassing' is not the word, but 'evil' is the better one to describe
what you did and ultimately what you are. You are what you do to get judged! 
And what you do, people have been talking and talking and talking. They may 
not know what you specifically did. Maybe they're completely wrong. But you 
should know that people love stories, even when they can only understand 
grunts and hee-haws. And there is no way to stop a storyteller by making 
your ears go deaf and closing your eyes. You would have to prove them wrong
in some way."

"What do you think I can learn from listening to that kind of chatter? Why 
would I even entertain these strangers' interpretations of what they supposedly
know about me. Where am I even suppose to go to hear this kind of talk about 
me? Or should I go to random places, and expect them to follow me, clearly 
chatting about me within ears' distance?"

"Then you don't know how society works. How will you learn?"

"Those people don't want me to learn, they want me to suffer and be buried
three feet deep. You know? Enough for me to breathe whatever air they do not 
breathe so I can live on and deal with their nuisances, but not enough to 
walk and trot along merrily to wherever I want."

"There is nowhere to go once the people start talking and talking about someone
or something except to the other side. And they still might send word to the 
other side to keep on mentally beating you down. How do you prove them wrong?" 

"The talk of people is like goldfish memory. They will find something else to
focus on, so that they can eat healthy and continue whatever they do."

"That's what you say, that people are like goldfish. Then why are you not 
surrounded by bags of gold for all the things said about you?"

"It's simple. These chatterboxes are not motivated to drop bags of gold at
my feet. I think they have very little, their talk and impressions is their
gold. Like you said before, I would have to prove them wrong!"

"Then how will you learn if you resist what they say?!"

"Must we continue this conversation? Then continue another day when they talk
about something else."

"Then why would we talk about the things that do not matter?"

"Do you have nothing else to talk about?"

"I was trying to tell you that people are talking about you."

"...And another one gets in line."

## son's conversation after work

"Look at you. You're all tired, sweaty, and look like a second-rate farmer
that still has to do everything manually because you're not smart enough to
use machines. Is that really how you want to die, son?"

"I...am...tired. Let me be..."

"Let you be...You say that like I am really ruining what little happiness you
have. You act like you're a happy and content person doing the menial work that
you do. But you are over-qualified. And worse. You are over-qualified and unwanted.
The demand is not there for what you have to offer outside of manual labor. I
hope you don't stand there like a farmer boy that has to take a second job working
construction, but I already know the answer. That's exactly the situation you
are in. You studied the arts and say you don't need much formal education. Then
you see those perfect rebels on television and the phone screens, with their
power and wealth even after becoming rebels to this confusing society that
calls itself a system when it is questioned, and you think you can hop onto their
bandwagon and become another Comrade Rebel. News flash, son, from their perspective,
you are the rebel and they are the norm. And from the general population's perspective,
you are the smart moron and they are the practical norm. So you stick out like a sore 
thumb, and I, being the good advisor of a father to you, have to tell you this
so you don't continue on being deluded in your make-belief world with make-belief
paths."

"Tell me!!! What should I do?! What is my destiny if you are confident enough to
see it written in the stars?!" 

"Your destiny is your own deal. You sound so humble to say that you have a destiny,
as if a higher power controls everything that happens about you and because of you.
But underneath your tone, you are arrogant and foolhardy. Do you really think you
can will the best destiny possible for yourself? You cannot, because destiny has only
one path for you that only it knows all about."

"Maybe it is you that is arrogant. I don't know for sure because I am too tired to
judge you for now. But I know for a fact that you are impatient about me. I think you
want me out of your life. You want me to have enough money to move out and not burden
you anymore. Why don't you say it loud and clear? And say it like you mean it, not for
more and more drama of the hard and stressful times."

"But I am in a better position than you. My perspective of you being arrogant counts
at least twice as much as you thinking and saying that I am arrogant. And I don't want
you to think I want you out so soon. What would be my destiny then? I would have to find
something else to do besides from fixing your head straight."

"So you more than admit that you are patronizing me? You take pride in that kind of
role, don't you? You want to elaborate on all the benefits of your patronizing when
you feel in doubt, to give you more motivation, to continue on patronizing me. You
work kind of like a machine, I'll give you credit for that."

"I don't take any pride in doing this to you, son. Believe me when I say the 
reason I do this to you is because you have no alternative patronage. I don't
want to die being the one that continually talks over your head, for the sake of my
being the superior one to you. But you know that every day that passes that you do
nothing but little chores here and there until you're really tired and get your daily
hours, is another day that takes a little away from what little chance you have to
climb the ladder."

"You have rather questionable viewpoints of that word, 'superior'. So this is another
conversation where you point out that I am stuck in a hole. There is no way out for me.
The solutions I have for improving my standing are poorly thought out, and the 
achievements I want for myself are delusions. Well, patron, you are something else 
with your negative motivation. I assume that despite us having two perspectives, that
you agree with me that the positive is the norm, and so your negativity is actually
something else."

"Look around you. Look at what you have tried, and what you have still amounted to.
You are at most at square zero, but if you consider the passage of time, then you are
at square negative, because you failed to walk forwards or backwards. Then you by default
lose time by walking backwards against your will. This is a little science lesson
for you. Not much, but enough to make you understand your place in society, in
this world of many superiors, at least to you because you are nothing. Nothing!!!"

"Then what do you suggest I do to at least try walking forwards? Work is hard to
come by here. You must acknowledge that I don't have much of a chance turning my 
hobbies into an actual occupation. I would need sponsorship from the patrons, and
they are forced to be deaf to letting me in because they have to deal with their
own situation of hazards. There is not one occupation I can think of that cannot be
questioned. But some occupations allow the person to silence the questions or at least
be cleared from the questions. Look at you, for example. You bite back hard when I 
contradict you. You want me to lose my nerve and shut up when I speak up to your 
questions and wisdom. I guess this is what you want me to aspire to. A person that
can silence the questions or be cleared from them."

"Is that another one of your idiot insights? I am saying all these words to you,
and to summarize, I only want for you to reach a place where you do not have to
answer to anybody. You know that is not the most accurate thing I want. You are
really simple to think that. I would not want for you to be unquestionable, at least
given how you are right now, because that means you would be capable of causing 
a lot of good or bad, and it would be like a video game to you."

"Maybe I should get some friends. I don't think I can improve myself if I continue
to have to deal with your wisdom after a full work day, every day. I think --" 

"You should! You should! You know no one has ever treated you as well as I do, and
you most likely won't find who you are looking for by actively searching. Go and
get some friends and talk to them. Maybe they can do your work for you and get
paid your salary on top of theirs. I want to see if you can get friends that can
really fix your head straight. That's a low expectation because I know there's not
one in this area that will give you a path. Look at me, doing all the talking 
in this conversation! I know this is only an exaggeration, but believe me when
I tell you that you will have a hard time finding a different patron that does
not have to split you up with another patron. Then what skills you have are 
spoiled in at least two halves! Your hobbies might have value, but you are 
fallible because of your position. You are a strange nobody and should get out
of my face to go talk to people you want to be friends with. Out!"

## son is forced to return home due to the economy

"I cannot say I'm happy seeing you back here. You look older if not wiser,son.
It is as if my wise words in the previous conversation made you older. So are
you here to tell me how much you've lost since the last time we met?"

"I could not find housing or a better job in this area."

"I expected that kind of answer from you. On the one hand, I am glad that my
predictions about you were correct, that you could not find something better.
It proves that I am not so insane after all. But on the other hand, I still
have to tolerate and accept the likes of you."

"I don't know how I should respond to that. If I voice my complaints to you,
then you would think I be soft, squirming around and not strong enough to 
tolerate the conditions. And if I voice my resolutions to you, then you will
probably say that those ideas are impractical and that they will lead to even
more problems."

"Exactly. Maybe you have grown wiser. You were smart to recognize that what you
wanted to say is meaningless in great part because it is vain and useless." 

"And what you just told me is a double whammy to what I wanted to say. I guess
what I wanted to say is completely out of the question now."

"Why don't you look ahead to the things that you can accomplish with reasonable
effort and without a lot of luck? That would be a good start for you. Remember what
I told you? Everything is a system. You don't have to believe that everything is 
a system, but that is what the real world really is, a system. You probably don't
believe me because you don't understand things from a systematic point of view, and
there are too many systems in this world for one single person to understand all."

"You have already started your good advice to me on what I am to do. You must finish
your thoughts on why everything is a system, and especially why I would greatly benefit 
from believing in that idea, one of many ideas."

"Oh, yes, you studied the arts. So the things that you don't expect and do not 
benefit you, you become outraged and deeply offended because you think it's 
unreasonable. I am not a professional scientist or engineer, so I cannot explain 
in depth to you what a system is. So take what I am about to say with a grain of salt.
A system takes inputs and produces outputs. There can be many products in between the
inputs and outputs. But usually, a system's output is quite predictable. For example,
a person that has these qualities and does these things can be expected to get some
outputs through the sequence of time."

"That's it? So you think I am daft because I have attempted things outside of some
system that determines my success? Is it because I do not have some specific qualities
and did not accomplish these things that I am stuck here talking to you, about your
idea of a system? Are you sure that my circumstances are really because I don't understand
what a system is?"

"Your questions have a very sour tone to them. See? I told you that you become so easily
offended by some things. And now you sound mighty offended after I told you what a system
is for your own benefit. Let me add. You don't have to have a deep understanding of what the
system is. In fact, many systems despise people that understand them too deeply because those
same people have the greatest capabilities to undermine them. What you should do in the system
is follow each step that the system tells you to do. You don't have to look ahead or look back,
but focus on each and every step that the system commands to you."

"Now it is me that does not think you're a realistic person. From the way you described a system,
it sounds like the system is not only an animate object, but a gentle one that calmly guides all 
its loyal followers to each of their wanted destinations. And the only starting requirement for 
each person in the system is obedience and ability to follow the instructions of the system.
But in reality, the system is governed by people, in areas such as farming, construction, 
technology, and media. I don't know about you, but I have never really thought about a person as 
a system. The human anatomy has been widely known for some time, but a person is more or less than
that standard human anatomy depending on what they work for and who they promote in real life."

"Yes! You make a good point! The system is run by people. Is that your way of objecting against the
system? You basically said, that because the system is run by people, and people are not really systems
that you can understand, then the system does not always work out for some people."

"That is exactly what I said, but I was being more specific and said it in more words. Listen. If the
system always produced the same output given the same inputs, then I don't think a lot of people would 
have an issue with that. The people that would really enjoy this kind of system would feel very safe
and secure because they think the outside world is dangerous but the system is reliable. But I 
personally would hate having to work for and in a system that was that predictable. A system that 
is that consistent means that I can go above and beyond or lo below within the margins and still end up
at the same place as someone else that does things differently from me. If a system that is run 
by people is that consistent, it also means that the system is unquestionable. There can be no alternatives
to those systems, no room to tweak it. Such systems must become maladaptive, don't you think?"

"Maybe that is your problem. You think systems are something to be toyed with, like a game
or something, because you studied the arts. You probably place low faith in other people, and think 
other people are susceptible to bias that benefits them. Think before you say things like that! A good
system is not maladaptive, but it will always have standards at any point in time. It might change things
here and there to face external problems. It might also disappoint some of its followers that have done
all the things asked of them, and still those followers do not get what they want. The systems that stand
the flaws and challenges of people, son, are the systems that require those people to believe in them.
Sure, those people can believe in other things, but the life they live and the work that they do, falls 
under the scrutiny of those systems. Sometimes, the systems display mercy to their followers. I don't
want to say anymore about what exactly systems do. But the main point is that until a system is replaced,
the people that work under it are at its mercy. And the people that work under a system must take a
terribly long time of trials and errors to be able to come up with better systems." 

"What does studying the arts have to do with my perspective of a system? I think in many ways,
my problem is that I have a broken ego. I am starting to get bored talking about systems and how
systems disappoint people. Systems that are supposed to reliably work fail people, and people fail
the system. Blah blah blah. From my perspective, every time I am set back because of the system, I
get back up but am forced to lose a little more faith in the system. I am supposed to look up to it, but
it can lie because it is fallible. And you think I do not believe in the system, but truthfully, I
do. That's why all of my setbacks and disappointments can be condensed into a broken ego, because
and for the system."

"Then why don't you just shut up and get some sleep then?!?! You don't have to say anymore about the 
system when you wake up! You are clearly too tired and mentally hurt to explain clearly to me what a 
system is. That is why you need to sleep, get up, shut up, and reaffirm your faith!!"

## a conversation on the economy of choice

"You know what? You should just quit whatever serious things you are doing,
and become a Hilarriosi."

"Do you really think so? Are you proposing that I don't need to listen to you
anymore? I did not know I have that much of a chance of launching a career out of
making people laugh. You must think I am funny enough!"

"That is probably the one thing you have said to me in your entire life that
makes me laugh! I'm being serious, here. I think that you would make a good 
Hilarriosi not because you're witty and charming. But because you're kind of 
like a donkey. You can be at the stage, say some random things, and hee-haw at the
end, and everybody will laugh at you! And then you could do that nutcracker
dance thing where you kick your behind repeatedly and the crowd would be in 
an uproar!"

"That is quite insulting of you. I feel very offended that you would say that
to me."

"It is as if you have no soul, son. You just go ahead and do and say things,
and think that you are right. I am at a real loss for words on how to assist
you. The words and wisdom I speak to you, it is as if my voice is the voice
of your conscience. Without my input, you would be soulless. And I stand by
that statement."

"The house is small. And I keep many of my thoughts to myself. If you are 
incapable of lifting my spirits, and instead you keep on telling me these
things, then I can promise you that nothing will change."

"In every recent conversation I've had with you, I am the one that has to
do the judgment, and to point out your problems. Do you think I get paid 
to say all those things to you? I do not, but maybe it makes me feel better
about myself, as if I am in control and that other people, meaning you, have 
issues that I am smart enough to recognize. And if I am smart enough to 
recognize those issues that you have, then I obviously do not have those
issues. I am the solution to those issues."

"The issue is that I want to branch out and live outwards, but I am stuck in
a maze of choices. Each of these choices is either impossible or results in 
something that I do not expect. I want what the better half of my peers have 
acquired, and it's not entirely about the money. The living circumstances are also 
important. And I am looking at you to see what other brilliant wisdom you 
have got to say."

"I see what you're saying. You are saying, indirectly, that I am the problem. 
You think that I am the one encroaching on your happiness. I suppose you have
a bunch of problems then. You want those things some of your peers have, and 
you also want to branch out and start your own thing. But you know that cannot
happen. If you try to branch out, you will fail at that. And if you fail at that,
you cannot get all those other things your better peers have. I have to say that
I teared up a little inside having to tell you what your problem is once again."

"Well, what tears you say you have, if they are there, they have to come from 
somewhere, like a good heart. Maybe that is what I should aim for, a stronger
will instead of always overthinking the things I cannot accomplish right away.
On some days, I think and think about problems that I do not enjoy having. And
you add more words and thus more problems to my mind sometimes. I don't want to
be rude, but I must confess!"

"Why don't you just go ahead and presume things, so you don't have to think 
too deeply about why those things are the way they are? That way, you can
just focus on doing what would make you better!!"

"That approach would clearly make me lose direction. I already told you that
the choices offered to me do not guarantee me positive results, despite my
efforts. So if I just focus on making decisions out of choices that I do not
control or like, then I foresee that I cannot go very far."

"No one demands that you participate. You say that you are given choices
that you know are worthless or bad, so you cannot make good decisions. But
don't you understand? If you don't participate in those kind of situations,
then you don't have to make any decision under that kind of influence. Instead,
you could expand your horizons, such as by branching out!" 

"Maybe that is another problem. Because there is no particular person that
demands that I participate, to make decisions out of the choices that they
have to offer, I can blame no particular person. I can hold no one accountable,
only myself for the misery of my circumstances. But the truth is, people 
control many choices made possible to people such as me. There is no choice 
for me not to participate in making decisions given the choices! That is an
important fact, so I cannot branch out! I cannot expand my horizons! The choices
for those possibilities to happen are not on the table."

"I don't know what else to say. But I am glad that I have never had to think
like such a miserable Hilarriosi! That's my best suggestion to you. Give up 
on anything serious and become a Hilarriosi. Who knows? You might get paid 
much much better being a clown idiot than someone that thinks they are a 
serious person."

## father describes his way of doing things

"The big difference between you and me,son, is that I am a literalist, and you
have these opinions on things that obviously have not paid you anything
other than self-doubt and narcissism."

"I do not know what a literalist is. I can only guess that you are saying that
you are a straightforward person that does what you say you are going to do
and rarely reneges on your promises."

"Yes! Yes! But you knowing what a literalist is does not mean that you know
how to be one or be someone of the same worth. Here is what I find amusing. You 
have a lot of self-doubt, but from what I see you think, say, and do, you have
a very narcissistic style to yourself, as if you think you are better or 
something. So your narcissism must rest on false grounds."

"You have to explain yourself more for your own favor, because I am not in the
mood for these debates on what I am, with you that happens so frequently."

"You say that like a true narcissist that cannot deny it. I will start off by
saying that I am a person of action, and what I see, do, and think, I do it
in a straightfoward way. I am neat and organized and do not need
to try too hard to remember things. Do you understand? Because I think and act
simple, then I am not so awkward or wasteful."

"And do you think I loaf around all day? I do a lot of work, manual work. And 
I do not think you can speak for what organization is. Maybe you meant the term
'obedience'. People have different ways of doing things. You sound like you want
people in my position to be very simple-minded. I suppose a literalist such as 
you must be very predictable because you think and act from a simple start."

"You are foolish because you assume that I work by simple ideas and actions, so I
cannot amount to anything out of the ordinary. But I am so much smarter than you.
My way of doing things makes me efficient. I take less effort to do the same things
that you try really hard to do. I can do anything!! Anything that you have tried to
do, I will probably succeed if I tried!! You overthink things and when you try to 
act on those things, your results are below my average."

"I take what you are saying to mean that I should give up. Do you know what morale
is? It really looks like you want me to follow your exact footsteps. You think
that I cannot think for myself, in the simple way that you say is the best."

"I do things by convention, and do not need to think so much about what other 
people think. Do you really think that I cannot be deceptive because I am 
simple-minded and act simple? You are wrong. In many ways, I can be far more
deceptive than what types such as you that value sophistication can be. I can
keep up with my act because I am simple. But someone like you, I can already 
picture you breaking down every so often because you have a lot of self-doubt
and low self-worth. You try to supplement yourself by being narcissistic, but
look how that has turned out for you."

"I don't quite know what you are going on about. I feel like my head gets spun
when you say these things to me. You are saying, that because I am not a literalist,
I cannot successfully do anything. I merely make attempts, you say, using approaches
that are very idiotic in reality, going back and forth on my words and actions, 
and that I fail as proof."

"A narcissist such as you does yourself your own favor by restating what I said in more
polite terms. My literalist approach, that I have used from the earliest age that I remember,
has rarely failed me. Sure, I have failed on doing some things, but I lean back on my
literalist approach, and accomplish those things I have failed for at least twice the
accomplishment."

"Now that is a lot of lies you are saying, at least one lie for every time you have failed.
You cannot say that your approach, that you call literalist because it is simple and direct, 
is superior because you have accomplished everything. Even the things that you failed you 
claim that you accomplished it again at twice the requirement. You say these things without
proof. The only truth you have really told me is that you believe that doing things the
simple way, that you say is literalist, is the best. And that is your opinion."

"You are a moron responsible for your own morale, or should I say, your lack of morale.
I see alternative ways of doing things mainly as failures. Look at the results of
your life's work so far, son. You owe money that you can barely pay off, and what 
you want is to live a dream that you imagined when you were awake. But you don't
know what you are attached to, what you will be attached to, and the troubles that
you will get if you fail to uphold some things."

"I previously said that in some situations, no one can really choose any particular thing. 
But you continue to say that my failures are the proof that I should follow your 
suggestion, to be a literalist. What if you are forced into an uncomfortable situation?"

"Then I don't respond. I keep things very simple because I only need to know a
few simple things. Then in those situations, I know nothing, I did nothing, and I do not
want to do anything."

"You do not understand! Your actions are what you choose to do, but you will always
have the limit of choice. If you say you will do nothing in those situations, then
you are doing something. And that is nothing. And depending on the situation, it is
only a matter of time before you fail. I tell you this so that you do not continue to 
say these crazy things to me."

"Your ideas are not really that original. Most of them are wasteful and copied from 
an origin, or even worse, they are the result of your arrogance. They let you
build nothing and go nowhere, just like what you just said to me. You think it is 
insightful, but I promise you it is nothing. When I wake up tomorrow and continue to
be a literalist, I will have already forgotten your fancy response. I think and act 
in a simple way. And look at you."

"And there you go again, picking some fault with my way of thinking and doing. Is that
what a simple person does?"

"In any of my deals, I uphold my end of the bargain, every time. I have never owed debt
that I struggle to pay off. I do not fail at so many things as you because I do not set
expectations that are really unrealistic. That's why my rate of accomplishment is higher
than yours. So you see, the chances that I can do anything that you have failed to do are
so much higher than yours. It is not even up for argument, I am 100% and you are nothing." 

"So... this is your literalist approach. I am no fool for trying my own way. You cannot 
speak for others, first and foremost, but if you do, you should not rush to saying that 
you are better!" 

"And that is why you should listen to me!!"

"Let us talk about narcissism another day, when you make the mistake of saying things
that make you look larger than you really are. That is my way of diagnosing narcissism."

# A Sad Chat Part VII
## son needs some guidance for his creative aspirations

"Son, I truly do not want to sound like a hypocrite for having to teach you
these things so that you can become smarter in both thought and action. I
do not think the education system that you went through, regardless of your
achievements or failures in it, has done a good job teaching you to be greater
than your failures that define you more than anything else." 

"Once again, you take apart the events of my life, and say that those events,
especially the failures that define me, are the result of some terribly flawed
thing that I should not have believed in. Therefore, I have very few people that
I can depend on, and those failures of the past should make me disown many of
the notions that I believed. And you want me to start believing in other things.
Am I correct in saying these things about you?"

"Look. You can go ahead and start arguing with me all you want, son. It does not
change anything because your words are only hot gas, the kind that cannot fuel
anything productive such as a system or even your pathetic psychological make-up.
I say this from a results-oriented perspective. I am not motivated by any
agenda, I promise, other than telling you what the terrible truth is. You think
that what I am telling you is terrible, because it goes against the things you
read and heard when you were younger. But if I don't say these things to you, 
then the silence of the education system will only make your listening ears 
useless."

"You don't know what I think doing the work that I do, the work that I do not 
enjoy because I think I am suited for something better. Because if you did, you
would know that what you are saying is too much for me to remember. I aspire for
something different. I believe in things such as alternatives, while you think 
that some alternatives are the absolute. When you say these things to me, I
interpret some of your words as the polar opposite from how I normally interpret
those same words to myself. Are you starting to see now?"

"What I see are the results!! Maybe I should stop talking about you as a failure,
since you are so clearly defined by your failures. I know if I keep on mentioning
how much you have failed, you will eventually take it as a personal insult if you
have not already. You need to open up your mind and take in this wisdom!"

"And you think I do not need to learn anything anymore! You think I need to put
my effort into doing things to the fullest instead! Am I right? Especially because
I was not the brightest or the best of the bunch during my school years, resulting
in the failures that continue to define me, then I obviously should disbelieve
education, in general."

"You have big problems for saying things like that! You take what I say, and digest it,
and then you produce feces instead of the wisdom that I originally shared with you. Let
me try to say some more things to you in a different way. Your creative pursuits and 
desire to be a leading force in some areas of work have not been successful. And I am
saying that it is not because of your failures or successes because of any one system,
such as the education system. But your failures have defined you more than your success
because of your misplaced beliefs."

"That is interesting for you to say that. I suppose that your thoughts expressed in 
different words shed a different light on what I suppose and believe in."

"Supposing and believing are not good enough, especially for you, son. Once again, look
at your results. You believed that your approach based on your views would have made you
successful, but they have not. There is no debate on that. Yet you still cling onto your
views, but your views can offer only those same approaches. And you know if you take those
approaches again, you will fail again."

"You are really starting to anger me with your input, I can tell you that. I suppose that
the main topic of this conversation so far has been my failure, that is my past and present
and most definitely my future if I do not heed your wisdom. But what you are asking of me
is for me to disbelieve more than half of what I think in the past, and to take your input
as the new approach that I should try. But you're wrong! You have to be! Think, if I could
not succeed in the past for my objectives, and I had a full and complete faith in what I 
thought and how I was supposed to act, then how can you expect me to take up a new approach
towards my aims! A new approach requires a renewed body of beliefs that a person must believe
in. I would be even more lost taking up these new approaches that you suggest. In fact, I 
would need to follow your lead."

"And that is why you clearly have problems. You believe in the power of teaching too much to do
anything on your own, from my perspective. I will tell you a very important principle on teaching.
Educators educate because they have reached their peak, and they teach those that are usually younger
than them to produce extra hands for them. They seldom educate the youth just so that the youth
will grow older and disown the beliefs and ways of thinking that were passed down to them."

"I cannot help but think that you are being obtuse. I do not repeat all the things I was told by
these educators. These educators in the society that I attended, that I still believe in, desire 
for the proliferation of knowledge to their students. It is up to the students themselves to do
what they think is right. For example, I write poetry in my free time. Some of the topics of my
poetry must surely be disapproved by those educators, because those words merely serve to upset
the balance. But those same words are also derived from the knowledge shared by those educators.
Who am I to say if what works of creativity I want to produce run contrary to the underlying
ethos of the seeds of that creativity, from those educators?"

"You misunderstand things, son. It is you that is obtuse, because you cannot change even with the 
lowliness of your life. I do not need to know any more about your poetry or what these educator
types think of it. That is the blessing of a literalist mentality, that I wish you would adopt 
sooner rather than later, when most of your life has been defecated away into nonsense that is 
subject to the whimsical praise and controversy of others. Poetry should always be treated as
entertainment. And your works of entertainment are not getting taken in by the entertainment 
enterprise, no offense."

"Argh!! Once again --"

"Once again I will repeat to you my wisdom in a different way!! The success of my literalist approach
is that I do not even need to read poetry to understand every thing talked about in poetry! I can 
understand things outside of the nuances and misinterpretation of words! I learn from the real world, 
and do real things, and I see poetry, especially from somone like you that probably writes about nothing 
but dandelions and mythical pony dolls, to be something already understood and thought of by me. It is 
just that I am not vain enough to think that those things have any meaning that is more real than 
the interpretation."

"Your arrogance suits you being in the position that you are in. However much I value subjectivity and my
need to do something that makes a real difference, not only the work that I do, your continuous input
erases my dreamy rumination and makes me motivated to not follow you, at least completely. I am sorry, 
but I would still be here, right in this social and physical position, if I had decided on another approach
to do the things I wanted to do."

"You probably think I am a sloth and a dull one, but I see that my words continue to knock you off balance.
If my words were really physical, like how poet types such as yourself think that words can transcend their
effects past the interpretation, then you would really be knocked off balance and struggle even to get up to
have to constantly defend against my strength, simple and direct due to my literalist mentality. And then, 
because you know that your poetics are so useless against the power that is me, you would be disarmed from
using your poetic language and then be forced into defeat. Are you now starting to grasp how useless the 
work and goals that you want really are?"

"Are you suggesting that we get physical?!? ..."

"The weak and insecure question that you ask me demonstrates my claims through your weakness. But I do not
want you to start believing that your empowerment will come at the expense of my dissolution. That is not a
contest that you want to start trying for. Besides, why try anything new when it is only giving without 
gaining and receiving without reaping? You know that what change through this word called creativity, that you
want to be a leading force in, is actually nothing new. Every new thing, new idea, new whatever is essentially 
a rearrangement of what already exists. I know deep down that you only want to gobble up power and produce 
decay and waste for everyone else. See, you must, because you must know something about the value of input and
output."

"Huh!! Look at you and your respectable holiness! If you think your respectability depends entirely on the height
of your projected appearance, you will not fight to beat your enemies. You will pick on ants instead!"

"Maybe you should just shut up... I tell you these things and you think the cause of it is because I want you to 
believe in the appearance that I am projecting. You see and know nothing, son. You are unfit..."

# A Sad Chat VIII
## father and son have a productive discussion about fairness

"One of the best things you can do, son, is to know what to fight for. Most of
these people do not have the resources to care. Their resources are for their 
own one direction. And I bet some of them wish much illness and suffering 
for you. So what is really stopping you from doing your own thing, turning 
your back on them, and wishing them at least as much illness and suffering 
as they to you? I will give you the answer. It is your own refusal to accept
those truths, ignoring them while expressing your ideas that you wrongfully 
think promote less ignorance."

"What good is what you are saying? I do not know the benefits of my using the
same tactics as some of those people you are talking about. Why would I need
to wish them much illness and suffering even if I do not care for them? That
does not sound very rational, because there is a large rift between the wishes
of a person and the natural will of things. And why would I want to bottle up
some of these ideas that I have? I should admit that I think it is personally 
healthier for me to promote some of my ideas than to leave them be for me to
forget all about them. And do you really think that if I turn my back on some 
of these people that they will really let me be, seeing as how the many paths
that people can take are usually crowded with different faces of competition?"

"You have to believe in the fairness of the things that have happened, the things
that exist, and the things that must happen because of the past and present. 
Instead, your brain is trying to come up with these alternative ways of thinking
based on the reasoning of your own brain's motives. And then when you see the
things happening, and try to recall the things that have happened, or read and
see the things of the past, you come up with these rare ideas about them that 
you think nobody else has ever thought of before even though you believe those
ideas to be better than what is the default. That is why your creativity is 
not very suited towards the natural way of things, sorry to say, son."

"You say that my way of thinking is alternative to that what is the default. But
I see nothing by default. I see many things out of order in its natural state. 
I see advantages that solve disadvantages and vice-versa. That is why I want to
go work in the creative industry, perhaps research and development. The work that
I could do there could make things that are usually disregarded and go to waste
be put to better use. If some of those things are already put to good use, then
there could be ways to improve those good uses for even better uses." 

"Your incessant need to want to go do your own work is your only accomplishment
that I have seen, and perhaps that will be the only accomplishment of your entire
life. People such as you use words such as `fair` and `kindness`, but you know that
people do not have to work to be `fair` and that the kindness they show to some people
is only favoritism that masks their malice for others. People do not have to work to be
`fair` because that word carries a double meaning, son. People can just be born beautiful
and comfortable. And then when they say that they want things to be `fair`, there is only
a limited range of things that they can make fair. And it's a constant fight for those things
to stay `fair`."

"I never said that things were fair or that things ought to be completely fair from the
start to finish. Although I do believe in the limits of organization, I think the best 
way to go about being `fair` is to play by a set of rules. By following a set of rules,
people can fairly promote each other's creativity. I would not have to try so hard to 
make some of my creative works shine. The new system of fairness would guarantee that 
my work will shine, and then I would be given my due credit without having to deal with
the harassment of those that play by different rules that don't like me."

"Fair?!? Fair?!?!? People don't really believe in sport, because different sports 
favor different people. You know that it is up to what you already have for you to 
build up on it. They are not going to guide you to really improve to win, except only
in cases where your victory benefits them, by making them proud and rich and 
such. Sure, they will share some words with you, such as `courage`, `persistence`,
`dedication`, and `talent`. But you know the power of those words only goes as 
far as how you interpret them in order to act on them. The same is true with what
new things you want to offer. What new things that you want to offer may already
exist but in a more accepted form, and the little changes to those things that 
you say are new in fact desecrate those things into a weakened version of its
former greatness. Perhaps it is fair that you cannot go do the work that you want
to do, because you are a challenger, a newcomer, a threat, even to me although we
are family!!"

"I am shocked. Shocked by what you have to say!! You do not believe in what I believe
in. You are only trying to discourage me! I use the word `fair` and you already say that
it has a dual meaning, as if no one can really agree on that word. You already see challenges
for what I want to do. You probably think that even if things became more fair, I would still
be below fair, even with --"

"Son...being fair means that you should not be so quick to blame me for your failures.
What is stopping you from doing anything? Think on that..."

# A Sad Chat Part IX
## son gets another perspective on how to care about things

"People don't have to like you, son. I want to make this point clear to you
in the hopes that you will be less naive. I can only hope, because I already
know you to enjoy believing in things that don't exist."

"That is a pessimistic outlook, plain and simple. I thought you told me that
it is best if I don't really give much of a care to most people."

"I am not speaking for you. I am speaking about what many must think, and you
should be smarter than to think you should not care at all. You don't have to
know much about people than to think that they probably do not have to like
you, especially with what business they already have. Think, if some of the 
most comfortable ones can say that there is danger about, and that there are
some people that must be kept an eye on, and some other people that secretly
plan evil things for others, then what happy hopes are there for the typical
person that is not as comfortable as those comfortable people. Those 
comfortable people have basically everything, and yet they still complain and
speak of what is dangerous, what is acceptable, and what is what."

"Your insight is hopeless. You say these truisms about what the good of people
is, but you know you cannot be entirely right. The truisms you say are part of
your own system of beliefs, the system that you use to think and act in the
world around you that you call a system. Maybe you are the one that that does
not see the real things." 

"You can doubt me all you want, idiotovyo. It does not change a thing about 
good in this world. Suppose you really care about someone, but they don't 
care about you and they especially don't care for your care for them. Then
what are you to do? Your care is wasted, even though it takes a beating heart,
and even if it is not, it can just as well take at most a second priority 
behind the judgments that people have already passed on you."

"So what if they do not care? My care comes from myself, and if I give away
that control to others, then what else can I do except for simply doing random
things? If you think that the solution for most people to fix their problems
is to learn to not care so much, then you must explain to me how this can be
achieved when the greatest friend and foe of a human being is another one."

"You don't have to be nice. You don't even have to care. You only have to learn
to coexist with other people. I don't have to say this because it is obvious,
but you already know that coexisting with other people is a challenge. You
especially have a hard time talking. Your thoughts are all over the place. And
you look different from other people. These are some of the reasons why you 
want to care so much, about everything even when it is beyond your reach or
control. You want to feel as if you belong, that not only your actions but 
your unwritten and unspoken thoughts matter. But I think your care is mostly 
a sad excuse, part of your defensive psyche against a world that you know
deep down does not care that much about you, so your care is a big effort 
from you to remain important, at least in your mind."

"Do you know what I think? I think you want me to be as apathetic and unhappy
as you. You speak strongly against what I do, what I think, and you should
understand, if my happiness depends on how I want to do things and how I want
to think, then you are saying that I should give up. I should keep on looking
inwards. You are saying the odds are stacked so heavily against any hope that
I have. Can you admit that you have to be somewhat miserable?"

"That's wishful thinking, son. Let me remind you that you cannot press any 
buttons to make me think or feel in any way. But I can't speak the same for
you, because you care! Remember!! Think of it this way. If no one cares about 
you, but you want to continue on caring about them, and you start to act out 
of line according to their eyes, then you are looking for conflict. You are 
wanting there to be separation and division, and what goodness of your care 
turns into something else, most likely a need to join the conflict to prove 
that you are right. Well, I could be wrong, seeing as how you do not have the 
spirit to care that much to take the extra step to act for it by any 
necessary means."

"You see the bad before the good, and you think there can be bad that results from
something that starts off as a hopeful idea, maybe turn into something so terrible 
that it overpowers any hope of the past. That is the type of person you are.
A belligerent person that needs to prove things and thinks that order comes
first, before any feelings or thoughts that upset the balance by more than
an inch. You should explain why you think I should follow your views, and have
to stand behind you in a long and harsh line, a line that can only be solved 
with some care in the right place."

"Ughh. It becomes a challenge for you to be accepted, only for you to reach 
a place where no one bats an eye at you, your words are misconstrued before 
you even voice them, and your world is just as small before as after, despite
the great things that you could have done. And to many people, they willfully 
look away from you because when they see you, they only see the mark of the 
beast on your forehead. And perhaps you will be wildly successful one day, but
you should know ahead of time, that people can just pretend to like you. Or 
they can pretend to hate you. Or they can really care about you, but because 
of the social norms and such, it would be inappropriate for them to display
public affection for you. Maybe someone really would care about you when 
you are successful, son, but they would probably not have the means or the
close contact for anything meaningful to come out of their care."

"Perhaps. You can continue voicing your theories. I'll listen, but you cannot
use that tone of voice with me and expect me to believe you. Even with the 
little means that I have, I know that you are only trying to get me to close
the doors to my possibilities. You would probably be very happy if those 
doors would then be locked by keys that can never be reached by anyone."

"Ha. That is what you say. But you already know it only takes one painful 
mistake or intention for my theories to be proven correct, at least in your
mind. Enough said, I do not want to wish you bad luck. You are probably 
too sensitive to think there is any bad luck planned for you."

# A Sad Chat Part X
## father explains what vanity is to his son

"I see you failing and struggling so much that I found the goodness of my 
heart, son, to be able to point out some more obvious truths about you in the
state that you are in."

"You start off by mentioning me as a struggling failure, so I am already 
expecting criticism. But if you believe it is good wisdom from the goodness
of your intentions, go right ahead."

"There are only a few kinds of things that a person can question given their 
position and what they have. And then still, there is the question of what 
skills the person has to ask questions for solutions. With that said, I
want to first make a big point to you so you know how to think about everything
else I will say later. It is this: your existence as a failure demonstrates that
you work not to be a solution but to be a question or to make questions. People 
don't like to feel in doubt, unless they have something to gain from escaping 
their hole of doubt. And you never really know, do you? But now you know that
you are not a solution but something like a question."

"But who is asking? If a person wants to feel in doubt, then they can go ahead.
But if they would rather believe their own personal stories to forget that there 
is a question, ever was a question, then they can also do that. Don't
you agree?"

"You asked your questions in a way that would make my answer favorable to your
stance. But I'm afraid I have better ideas, and so do other people. You cannot
really think for other people. And because you cannot really think for other 
people, you can have control over at most their immediate decisions, but there
is still the question of their decisions afterwards."

"So I am at the back of the line, by your perspective. And why don't you think
I can ever think for other people?"

"I can only say things that I see right now and in the past. What you aimed
for, you have not achieved according to the metrics of the system. The work
that you want to produce that you think is creative is actually questionable.
Why is it questionable, you might ask? It is because the system justifies
itself. The system is an umbrella for everyone under, but there are still
some people that need to hold that umbrella for everyone else. You want other
things, and it is obvious because the system is already too busy. It can 
justify itself when asked about the fates of everyone under it. Are you 
starting to see, now, your own vanity?"

"Well, I think you allowed a loophole in your explanation. Maybe the system
is too busy now, but when it finally catches a break, it can reflect on all
the things it ignored. Maybe I will shine then."

"That is hope. The hopes in the gambling language of `maybes`. Sometimes, it
does no good to be expressive, to speak up, simply because good does not always 
win. Keeping your head down will save you the trouble of thinking, especially 
with your hopeless goal of wanting to be the thinker for everyone else."

"I do not gamble because I believe my efforts are for something more than real. 
My efforts are not for some game designed by someone else, for prizes
already determined by others based on their solutions. I can compete, although
you call me weak."

"Competition, you say? You are already in a weak spot. It is quite unwise of
you to say that you want competition when you are at a disadvantage. You ask
for fair competition in your weak position so that you can become something
more, but what you will get is competition that does not have to play fair
or give you your fair share. You might as well be a shadow player aimlessly
competing until the competition has broken you. And then that would be your
reward, your being broken by the competition because the system had other 
plans for you." 

"I believe your words would be better suited if I were a gambler of a 
competitor, but I know what I am doing. I do not rely on luck when it is
my physical work and personal thoughts that make my products the way that
they are."

"And that is why you are not a solution in the system. And your arrogance 
makes you even more detestable, so much that what competition you want to 
have will probably have arranged for your failure already even if you will
never compete with them!"

"Your thinking makes me want to laugh, but then I would really be arrogant.
I want something more, and already you are saying that I am arrogant."

"Like I said before, there are only a few things that you can question. In
the system, it would be most unwise for you to question its successes. A
person that questions the successes of the system they live in is usually
deemed a turncoat, a hypocrite, a troublemaker, or all of those things.
And if you try to question the failures of the system, then its proponents
can scoff at you and treat you as an ungrateful problem, perhaps even the 
cause of those same failures of the system. This is why you should just be
a simple person, because what you want to do is a big leap from a ground of
your own low quality." 

"When a person has only a few aims in life, and you say that a person should
give up on those things, you can expect them to not heed your words but 
instead entirely give up."

"I believe you, but what a person does is not up to them. Look at what you
are doing now, nothing that you want, as proof. There are all kinds of social
systems, but all of them can be labelled as one of two things. In one kind of
social system, you cannot expect anything your way with certainty. And in the
other kind of system, you cannot expect anything else." 

"You present me no options, no steps on the staircase that people such as you
have helped to seal off."

"What is the big rush, then, son? You cannot think of anything else to the 
contrary that would make things go your way. What use is it if you think I
am the enemy? You have no steps and cannot expect anything else."

# A Sad Chat Part XI
## son is lost and depressed, and thinks there is a better path

"You think your life is bad because you cannot land a reputable job for a reputable
social status. But things could always be worse, son. You don't have to personally 
experience the things that are worse to understand. You only have to read and hear 
about them."

"I want to feel a sense of purpose in my life. But based on my surroundings, I
cannot be satisfied in my mind. I grow more restless and upset each day 
because I believe it is time that I move on to the next stage of life, where 
I can start to really professionally develop. This place that I am in right 
now has very little for people of my skills."

"If you really want to be mentally satisfied, then you are going about it the
wrong way. There is no place on this planet that could fit those grand definitions 
by the fantasies of humans and the holy books. Don't you think it
would be more wise to save your anger and restlessness for the opportune time
to do what you want?"

"Do you really think that a person has the moral obligation to control how
they feel, what they dream about, and what they want to do? You are deluded if
you do, and I never said that I was looking for the perfect place, but something 
more fitting and allows for more advancement than what this place I am in has 
to offer."

"Your anger is uncalled for, and I am simply telling you that you can never get
to where you think you would be happy by trying to walk there in anger and haste.
You are still sitting here, in this house that is headed by me, son. Until you 
learn to stop wasting your care and effort on getting to some place just so you 
can get a glorified job title and work to satisfy some stranger that is your 
supervisor, you will have to continue tolerating what I have to say to you so 
that your vanity is fixed."

"Vanity?! Vanity?! A person does not know what their life should not be until
they can only work the jobs that do not suit them, see the seconds of their
life slipping by on nothing they hold dear, have the most depressing or looney
of people to interact with, and can relate to those they hate or look down on.
Then they would really question the essence of their life. I am this person 
that I have described."

"Oh, really?! Is that so? You have not even reached middle-age yet, son, and 
you think you already know exactly what a person does not want their life to be
based on your own viewpoint. Am I that depressing and looney person that you 
have to interact with? Am I the one that you hate or look down on? Why would you 
question the essence of your life anyways, especially when you are still
alive?"

"It is precisely the fact that I am still alive, and in full awareness of my
own state of living, that I question the essence of my life that is not favored
by anyone, even you, to go anywhere that I believe would grant me 
happiness."

"Then you are clearly trying to be a fool, not that you need to put any effort
into it. You cannot expect anyone to praise or admire you when you do not even 
value yourself. If you know that there is not much room for compassion and 
care in a world that values only achievement, acceptance, and appearances, and 
you think the solution is to question the essence of your life, then it is better that 
you keep that a secret. What someone else sees is not a sensitive and introspective 
person, to be rewarded as a great humanitarian, but a vulnerable person with low 
self-esteem issues. A lost dog! A fool destined to beg!"

"Praise is the last thing I need from those that have clear differences with
me. What I need is a promotion! A definite change that is positive! A path that
would make me a believer, not a challenger that always has to swim against the
tide, or a strange one that deserves raised eyebrows and suspicious whispers from
others."

"You are so funny, son! Do you really think that you can simply walk some steps 
towards some place, and then you would suddenly have the spirit to believe?! And
if you believe, you would never have to push yourself and fight ever again?!
Son, you live in a system that can justify itself every time, and does not have
to answer anything you ask or demand. And the system especially does not have to
guarantee you any path that is too comfortable for the likes of you. Look at what
you are right now! It is very self-evident that you need to work and suffer for what
you are always wasting your present moments dreaming about. You are quite pathetic
if you cannot come to terms with the challenges you are facing now, just to move
up to some place that is far from a dream to face even greater challenges."

"Maybe I said what I wanted to say in the wrong way. But you know what? A world of
helplessness changes how a person thinks and acts. When a person lives in a place
deliberately designed to be dysfunctional, according to this thing you call a system,
and the things they hear and read about never come their way, then they have a right
to ask questions about how the system has treated them. I continue to ask myself about
my state of happiness and the different paths that would most benefit me."

"So you are helpless then? Then why do you continue to think and act in ways that ruin
any chance of you achieving present happiness? I will clarify for you, son, since you
have nothing but questions about your own life. You do not have the spirit to even help
yourself. You are in a state of denial about what will grant you a happier life. The least
that you can do is forget about the false paradise crafted by those to suck the happiness
out of their believers."

# A Sad Chat Part XII
## end conversation

"This is perhaps the last serious conversation that I will have with you, son.
I am getting old, and it is really for the better that you do whatever it is
you well please. I admit, the moral authorities and the intellectual authorities
like to have their fun with people such as yourself, even when their treatment
takes twisted turns. That is how the economy of life works from superior to
subjects."

"Out of all the conversations we have had, I think that this will perhaps be the
greatest. Finally. I can be recognized by at least one elder, and that is you,
as someone worthy to move on ahead in life. Please, go on and share your parting
thoughts."

"You are celebrating, aren't you, after hearing from me that I need not talk to
you anymore. Fine, then I will also join in on your celebration, son. Good for
you. Very very good for you. Is that what you want to hear?"

"Hearing words under such a tone, I think not. I hope this conversation does not
turn into something so inauthentic as to ruin this parting occasion."

"You are asking the question of authenticity when what is really authentic is your 
own problem to solve. Do you want to know what is not real? It is that after you 
go on your way, that you think will make you merrier, then the world's truths will 
open up in ways that unquestionably benefit you. Think again. It is a trade-off
since you are in no position to completely absolve yourself of responsibilities
you do not willingly take up. You are, effectively, going to have to sign 
yourself off to someone or something else. You will always be part of the great 
deal, even if you are the one that personally does the signing on those terms."

"And what is the great deal? Is that how you think of all of these things in this
world you call a system? What exactly is the exchange, and from whom to whom?"

"Those are questions that only the course of life you take will provide you with
answers. Every person is bound by their own deal in the great deal. Many of these
personal arrangements are conveniently given to them along their singular path 
from birth to present. And if their own deal involves negating the deals of 
others that might have rightfully earned them, then you should be wise to concoct
your own personal way of holding onto your position. There may come times when 
you will take a leap off a cliff that you never could have saw coming. Think on
that. Sometimes, those that trouble themselves into thinking about the worst are
given their fair share of justice by never having to deal with the consequences 
of the worst. Maybe the only reward you will ever get in this life is that of
never having to experience the most dreadful of all surprises, despite deserving
the wealth and power from your own skills."

"I am confused by what you are saying. You sound very demotivating, perhaps even
threatening, against my ambition. I do not know why you practice such austere 
thinking that you then try to transfer over to me. You give me more stress in the
process, while I see some of my peers become very prosperous by their families'
transfer of wealth over to them. I understand that individuals have to work 
within their means to get what they want, but I feel very deterred by your 
statements."

"Perhaps, but my statements are part of your deal, your personal circumstances in
the great deal. You do not really know what is or what could be in store for you.
But you will have to come to terms with what could never be in store for you, 
especially if you do not break rank in the right way. That is the nature of the
word `ambition` you are talking about, a game for gamblers of the highest caliber
of human society. But on the great deal, what is it? Who really knows everything? 
I do not know, but I know that there are already differences from the start, and 
those differences could result in very malicious dynamics when they become reinforced
into indisputable statements of superiority."

"Look at you, talking about the malice that is indisputable statements of
superiority. You have a habit of talking down to me with a tone that is a
complete demotivator, and I do not understand how you can turn around and
denounce the idea of indisputable superiority without at least feeling like a
hypocrite."

"But I am a hypocrite, son, and you will be an even greater hypocrite from what
you are now through the course of your life. You should be aware of the fact that 
many things that you do will not build you a fortress that upholds your glory and 
your glory alone. Many of the things that you do are actually quite susceptible to
the whims and judgments of others. I know of a great many people that have had to
work hard and suffer even more terribly, haunted and subverted in a world of 
systemic grudges. Yes, systemic grudges enacted by those to rectify what they
perceive are wrongs that cannot be repaid in any other way but by seizing the
successes of those preyed upon and giving them a big pile of problems in exchange."

"Systemic grudges, you say? That is a new one to me. When you use the word 
`system`, I tend to assume that there is a cold rationale to all its rules and 
procedures. But thank you for reminding me about the beast in the system." 

"Let me remind you some more things, especially on the topic of disparity. You
will be met with resistance from all corners of the world. And you will also 
realize all the suffering that the world has offered to some lives. For example, 
perhaps you will become so great and successful one day as to become the ruler of 
many. But at that point in time, there is the disparity between you, the ruler 
that has to take a seat during most of the action, and the actors, who are the 
ones directly responsible for carrying out actions that can be important or 
trivial."

"I know not to rush to that aspiration in my head. Is there anything else?"

"Plentiful for you to hear, to compensate you for all the gold that you would
have had if you lived another life. There is the disparity between responsibility
and suffering, opaque topics that sometimes coincide with each other. For example,
perhaps a person is able to acquire enough wealth to get what they want. But in
the process, they made powerful enemies, so threatening that in order for them to
uphold their successes, they would have to metaphorically tie themselves to powder
kegs to discourage their enemies from attacking."

"Well, I surely hope that I do not attain wealth only to have to tie myself to
powder kegs as a form of defense against those that intend to take what is 
rightfully mine. I think I have suffered enough, so my best guess is that 
whatever responsibility I can achieve will not automatically come attached to
undue suffering."

"Sure, son, sure. Go ahead and make those dreamy predictions about your future,
but keep them in your head so that I can finish my talking about the disparity
that this world has to offer. There is the disparity between those deceased 
in your life that were unconditionally loving to you and those that continue 
on surviving to feed off of your happiness, to chain you to their own crude
representation of you, all in their hopes to cause you more trouble than what
is natural. And lastly, there is the disparity between those that have always done 
the right thing to achieve a right place that then limits their role in the 
system, and those that can do the right thing by rectifying and reforming the 
rights and wrongs that they have great experience in dealing in. Let me explain 
more clearly what this means, because it is very important for your moral
development. Some people will never be really tested. Never. And it is not 
necessarily because of an innate injustice of the world, but because of the
additional choices that come with those individuals' choices. People can only 
really relate to those that look like them, talk like them, or at least share some 
kind of connection with them unless they venture outside. There is a lawless 
economist in every person. Just as some people cannot be helped, some cannot 
really help to solve without breaking rank and making enemies. And after all 
is said and done by some of these heroic icons, those unsung heroes, and villains 
both imaginary and real, perhaps all this, the system, this life that you live, is
all for show. A performance. A joke against your existence that you think is so 
serious. So think and choose carefully, son, and try to never let the malice of
anger, jealousy, and hatred disrupt your course." 

"You have given me a lot to stomach, father. I do not believe I can ever 
understand all these things you have just explained to me, just as how I do not
really know the contents of all the great meals that I have eaten here in this 
household even though my body still appreciates them."
